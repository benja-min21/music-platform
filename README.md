## Question 1: Website Creation

I created a personal music platform called **Ben Music Hub**. The website allows users to view favourite songs, watch music videos, explore artists, and contact the website owner.

The website contains over 25 HTML elements and 15 HTML attributes. Semantic HTML elements were used to properly organize the content.

## Question 2: HTML Elements

### 1. Most Challenging Elements

• Video – It was challenging because it required adding source files and compatibility support.  
• Table – Structuring rows and columns correctly required attention.  
• Form – It required multiple inputs and validation attributes.  
• Article – Understanding when to use it was difficult.  
• Aside – Learning its role in supporting content was new.

---

### 2. Semantic Elements Usage

• Header was used for navigation and title.  
• Section was used to divide different content areas.  
• Article was used for song information.  
• Footer was used for copyright and navigation.

---

### 3. Most Useful Element

Section was the most useful because it helped organize content clearly.

---

## Question 3: HTML Attributes

### 1. Essential Attributes

• href – Enables navigation links.  
• src – Loads images and videos.  
• required – Validates form inputs.

---

### 2. Class vs ID

ID is used for unique elements like navigation targets.  
Class is used to group multiple elements.

---

### 3. Best Attribute for User Experience

Placeholder improved user experience by guiding users on what to enter in forms.

---

## Question 4: Development Process

### 1. Planning

I first designed the website layout by identifying sections like home, songs, artists, videos, and contact.

---

### 2. Testing

I tested by opening the website in a browser and checking if links and forms worked.

---

### 3. Challenges

I struggled with organizing tables and video embedding but solved it using documentation and testing.

---

## Question 5: Git & GitHub Implementation

### 1. Git Commands Used

git init  
git add .  
git commit -m "Initial commit"  
git push origin main  

---

### 2. Commit Strategy

I made commits after completing major sections like homepage, songs section, and contact form.

---

### 3. Importance of Version Control

Version control helps track changes, prevents data loss, and allows collaboration.

---

## Question 6: Code Quality

### 1. Validation

I ensured HTML was valid by testing in browser and checking syntax.

---

### 2. Best Practices

• Proper indentation  
• Semantic elements  
• Clear naming  

---

### 3. Improvements

I would add CSS styling, JavaScript features, and more songs.
